title: Page Visibility API for Defold
description: HTML5 extension that provides Page Visibility API integration for Defold games, allowing developers to detect when the page is visible or hidden and pause/resume game systems accordingly. This creates a better user experience compared to window focus/blur events, especially for games embedded in iframes.
