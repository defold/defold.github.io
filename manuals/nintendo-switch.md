# Nintendo Switch development

Due to Nintendo licensing restrictions access to Defold versions with support for the Nintendo Switch platform is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with Nintendo Switch support you need to become an approved game developer for Nintendo Switch.


## Registering as a Nintendo Switch developer

You can register as a game developer for Nintendo Switch at the [Nintendo Developer Portal](https://developer.nintendo.com/register):

When you have been approved by Nintendo you will get access to the Tools and Middleware page of the Nintendo Developer Portal where you can sign up for Defold access. When you register for Defold access we will get an email from Nintendo verifying you as a registered Nintendo developer.
