title: Defold development for PlayStation®4
brief: This manual describes how to get PlayStation®4 access
---

# Development for PlayStation®4 console 
Due to licensing restrictions, access to Defold versions with support for game development on PS4™ is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with PS4™ game development support you need to be registered as a licensed PS4™ game developer.

<div class='sidenote' markdown='1'>
Defold currently only provides support for the PS4™ console. Games made for PlayStation®4 will also run on PlayStation®5 in compatibility mode. Official PS5 console support will be available later.

## Registering as developer for PS4™ game development
You can register as a game developer for PS4™ game development from the [PlayStation™ Partners page](https://register.playstation.net/partnership)

When you have been approved by Sony you will get access to the Playstation®4 DevNet. Navigate to Development > Tools & Middleware > Tools & Middleware directory > Defold. Click the 'Confirm Status' button.

## PS4™ access in Defold 
Once we have received confirmation of your status as a licensed developer for PS4™ we will provide you with access to the following:

* Source code access to the PS4™ extension with console specific API integrations.
* Source code access to the PS4™ enabled version of the Defold game engine. Note that the source code access is not required to build games for PS4™, but we provide access in case you wish to make source contributions to the engine core.
* [Command line tool](/manuals/bob) with support for bundling to the PS4™ platform. Bundling from the Defold editor is not supported.
* Forum where you are able to get PS4™ specific support.
