# Defold 1.11.2

## Localisation of the Editor!

We’ve started localizing the editor UI! While the process isn’t fully complete yet, many parts of the editor have already been translated — and we’re looking for localization contributors.

We host our [localization project](https://crowdin.com/project/defold) on Crowdin. Join the project, choose the language you’d like to contribute to, and start translating the editor strings directly in Crowdin. All UI text is stored in the [`en.editor_localization`](https://github.com/defold/defold/blob/dev/editor/resources/localization/en.editor_localization) source file, and Crowdin automatically exports the translated files back into the repository.

If your language is missing, use the *Request language* option in Crowdin, and we’ll add it for you. When translating, make sure to preserve placeholders such as `{template}` exactly as they appear in the source string — we use the [ICU message format](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/messages/) for variable interpolation.

Once translations are approved in Crowdin, they will be automatically incorporated into the editor.

## Engine
__NEW__: ([#6553](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11278)) __'Add gui.cancel_animations() to cancel one or all animation(s) at the same time'__ by JCash
We've renamed the function to better match `go.cancel_animations()`
The function can now cancel a single animation of a node, or all animations at the same time:
```lua
gui.cancel_animations(node, "position.x") -- cancel a single animation
gui.cancel_animations(node) -- cancel all animations
```

⚠️ The old function `gui.cancel_animation()` is now deprecated. Please use the new one instead!

__NEW__: ([#11281](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11281)) __'Add Dualsense driver mapping for Linux'__ by wfzyx


__NEW__: ([#11360](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11363)) __'Simplify `dmGraphics::IsTextureType3D(TextureType)`'__ by vil02
This resolves [`misc-redundant-expression`](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc/redundant-expression.html).

I did not observe more warnings of that type in defold code.

__FIX__: ([#11298](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11332)) __'Issue 11298 resolve sound deadlock on Windows'__ by deurell
Resolve sound deadlock on Windows when disconnecting sound device.

__FIX__: ([#11330](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11355)) __'Add caching for the “vanilla” engine when downloaded through Bob.jar to avoid repeated downloads'__ by AGulev
To keep Bob.jar lightweight, it doesn’t include all platform architectures and symbols. When needed, the “vanilla” engine is downloaded from the CDN.
This update introduces caching for those downloaded files in the `.internal` folder, avoiding repeated downloads on each bundle.

__FIX__: ([#11356](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11356)) __'Provide debug symbols for all HTML5 target architectures and build configurations'__ by AGulev
HTML5 symbols are now provided for all build types and platforms: a folder `<project_name>_symbols` containing all symbols is created alongside the bundle.

__FIX__: ([#11366](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11366)) __'HTML5 profiler now reports the correct memory usage'__ by smagnuso
On HTML5, our in game profiler now returns the memory usage as reported by Emscripten.
This affects both our in game profiler `Memory` variable, as well as the `profiler.get_memory_usage()` Lua function.

__FIX__: ([#11315](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11315)) __'Add support for running the Android tools in bob from the commandline'__ by britzl
Added the ability to run`aapt2` (Android Asset Packaging Tool), `bundletool` and `jarsigner` from the commandline.

```sh
java -cp bob.jar com.dynamo.bob.tools.AndroidTools aapt2 link --proto-format ....
java -cp bob.jar com.dynamo.bob.tools.AndroidTools jarsigner -verbose -keystore debug.keystore ...
java -cp bob.jar com.dynamo.bob.tools.AndroidTools bundletool build-apks --bundle= ...
```

__FIX__: ([#11380](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11380)) __'Added dmResource::GetWithExt() to dmsdk for more robust resource loading'__ by JCash
This allows the developer to pass in an expected extension, in order to make sure that the resources path passed in is the correct type. This is especially helpful if the code is data driven and the developer doesn't know the resource path beforehand.

[Documentation](https://defold.com/ref/beta/engine-resource-src-dmsdk-resource-resource-hpp/#GetWithExt:factory-path_hash-ext_hash-resource)

~~__FIX__: ([#9917](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11369)) __'Fix frustrum culling for sprites with pivot point'__ by ekharkunov~~
~~Fixed culling for sprites with pivot points. Also implemented some optimization on how geometry data calculated and stored between batches. So no it should be a bit faster in terms of calculation but consume some memory to store cached information.~~

__FIX__: ([#11397](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11398)) __'Fix for when bitmap font uses 4 channels which caused a crash'__ by JCash



## Editor
__NEW__: ([#7930](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11311)) __'Automatically save any changes in the editor whenever it loses focus'__ by AGulev
Introduced a new option that automatically saves all open files in the editor whenever it loses focus.

__NEW__: ([#8495,#11007](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11359)) __'Enhanced the orthographic camera behavior in the editor for better usability and accuracy'__ by AGulev
- Orthographic camera gizmo size in the scene view reflects `game.project` display width/height and Orthographic Zoom.
- Orthographic camera FOV is now disabled when Orthographic Projection is enabled.
- Perspective-only fields are disabled in orthographic mode.
- Orthographic Zoom must be greater than zero; invalid values show an error.

__FIX__: ([#11290](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11301)) __'Fix Tile Source Collision Group colors in Outline'__ by matgis


__FIX__: ([#11314](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11337)) __'Feed positions and normals to all vertex attributes with a matching semantic-type'__ by matgis
The editor now supplies positions and normals to all vertex attributes with a matching semantic type when rendering objects in the Scene View. This reverts a change introduced in #10635, which caused a regression for shaders that make use of both world-space and local-space attributes of the same semantic type.

__FIX__: ([#7713](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11375)) __'Ensure the camera component icon (gizmo) maintains a pixel-stable size on screen'__ by AGulev
Ensure the camera component’s icon in the editor stays a constant size regardless of scene scale.

__FIX__: ([#11365](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11365)) __'Update welcome screen for better discoverability.  '__ by AGulev
Moved the Templates, Samples, and Tutorials sections from a submenu to the root level to improve discoverability and make them easier to access.

__FIX__: ([#11438](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/11438)) __'Editor: Fix page count mismatch detection and error message for sprites'__ by matgis
Fix issue where paged Materials were erroneously detected as unpaged when inspecting Sprite properties.
