## Engine
__NEW__: ([#7555](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7555)) __Apply `game.project`'s values using the Mustache templates to `gradle` and `pod` file__ 
Now, it is possible to use Mustache templates in `gradle` and `pod` files as well as it always has been for the main manifest files (depends on a platform: `index.html`, `info.plist`, `AndroidManifest.xml`)

__NEW__: ([#7538](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7538)) __Upload Defold SDK and reference documentation to GitHub on release__ 
This change will upload the defoldsdk.zip and ref-doc.zip to GitHub on every release of Defold.

__NEW__: ([#7463](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7463)) __Add warning when trying to load HTML5 build from local filesystem__ 
A common mistake for beginners is to double-click on index.html when attempting to test an HTML5 bundle. This will not work since the browser is unable to load the rest of the files required to run the Defold game. This change adds a warning message and instructions on how to test an HTML5 build locally:

__NEW__: ([#7452](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/7452)) __Update Xcode to 14.2 and iOS to 16.1__ 
It is now possible to build for iOS 16.1 and use libs which were built using Xcode 14.2.

__NEW__: ([#7581](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7581)) __Materials for paged atlas support__
Added sprite and particlefx builtin materials for paged atlas support

__FIX__: ([#7542](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7542)) __Changed default animation playback mode for implicit one-image atlas animations__ 
This change makes sure that implicit single image atlas animations use a playback mode of "none". Previously an editor build set the playback mode to "once forward" while a bundle set it to "none". This causes problems since "once forward" will generate an "animation_done" message while a playback mode of "none" doesn't.

__FIX__: ([#7465](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7465)) __Bugfix for using multiple rendertargets in WebGL2__ 
Fixed a regression for multiple rendertargets when running in a WebGL 2 context. We previously checked if the appropriate functions exist to support multiple rendertargets, but in WebGL 2 we can correctly assume that the functions exist since they are part of the baseline specification. We have also added a validation function for WebGL that checks if all the attachments of a rendertarget has the same size, which is a requirement as per the specification.

__FIX__: ([#7540](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7540)) __Make sure to update euler or quaternion rotation before returning it to the user__ 
This fixes an issue when getting the `rotation` or `euler` property of a game object in a `go.animate()` callback where the value was not updated to the final value at the time when the property was read.

In the case when getting an euler angle using `go.get()` and the **euler angle has not changed** it is first updated from the quaternion value. And in the case when getting a quaternion rotation using `go.get()` and the **euler angle has changed** the quaternion is updated with the value from the euler angle.

__FIX__: ([#7524](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/7524)) __Fix threading issue in dmSSLSocket__ 
When running the unit tests through Thread Sanitizer, it hightlighted an issue of using a globally held struct (the config).
Since the operations are modifying this struct, it is best to make sure the access is limited to one thread at a time.

__FIX__: ([#7527](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7527)) __Improved atlas generation performance__ 
Improved atlas layout generation speed for ~75%

__FIX__: ([#7406](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7406)) __Use locale-insensitive conversion from lower to upper case in bob__ 
This fixes an issue when using the bob command line tool to bundle a Defold project on an operating system with a locale which is does not have a standard lower to upper case mapping, such as Turkish (where a lower case i becomes İ, ie a capital I with a dot).

__FIX__: ([#7541](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7541)) __Update BasisU 1.16.4__ 
Basis UASTC updated to the latest at the moment, version 1.16.4. It speeds up encoding process (Compression: Normal) for 12-15%.

__FIX__: ([#7550](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7550)) __Fix crash when changing sprite atlas and sprite has an invalid animation__ 
Fix crash when set new atlas which has more animations than the old one but without animation with the same name which currently playing.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#7539](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7539)) __Add an option to open a project from the editor__ 
Added a `Open Project...` menu item in the File menu. It will launch another instance of the editor.

__NEW__: ([#7478](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7478)) __Expose "playback rate" and "offset" to sprite component__ 
Now it's possible to set `offset` and `playback rate` for animation in sprite components itself.

__FIX__: ([#7552](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7552)) __Gracefully handle the deletion of an edited table cell__ 
deleting a row with a currently-edited table cell no longers throws an exception.

__FIX__: ([#7547](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7547)) __Show Defold version in window title of main editor window__ 
The main editor window title shows the confusing "Defold Editor 2.0" text. This version number has no correlation to the actual Defold version used. This has now been changed to instead show the actual Defold version used, eg "Defold Editor 1.4.5".

__FIX__: ([#7526](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7526)) __Additional fixes to root-level game object transforms inside referenced collections when building from the editor__ 
(Regression introduced by #7504)


* Additional fixes to root-level game object transforms inside referenced collections when building from the editor.

__FIX__: ([#7553](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7553)) __Strip brackets from array uniform names during editor shader reflection__ 


__FIX__: ([#7517](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7517)) __Don't show submenu shortcuts for command options__ 
Previously, sub-menus like `File -> New` and `Game Object -> Add Component` showed the same shortcut on every option item. This changeset turns this behavior off.

__FIX__: ([#7504](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7504)) __Fixed root-level game object transforms inside referenced collections when building from the editor__ 
* Fixed root-level game object transforms inside referenced collections when building from the editor

__FIX__: ([#7499](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7499)) __Prevent editor exception when key up is pressed in curve editor__ 
This prevents an exception from being thrown when manipulating a curve handle using key up in the curve editor.

__FIX__: ([#7501](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7501)) __Use required Accept header when contacting GitLab.__ 
This changes fixes an issues when using dependencies hosted on GitLab.

__FIX__: ([#7512](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7512)) __Make the debugger more resilient to unexpected chars__ 
The problem is that somehow, in one of the projects the debugger stack reported by the game included a [NEL](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+0085) character in the data. This resulted in regex `(.*)` failing, since `.` does not match the NEL character:

```clj
(re-match #"." "\u0085") => nil
(re-match #"." "\u0086") => []
```

The solution is to make the regex that separates `OK` from the EDN data structure only look at the `OK\s+` part of the string and get the remainder using `subs`, which `re-match` already does.


Debugger is more resilient to the stack information received from the game when it contains control characters like [NEL](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+0085).

__FIX__: ([#7488](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7488)) __Fix editor freeze after editing certain properties__ 
* The editor no longer freezes after editing certain properties, such as the path of a referenced component.

__FIX__: ([#7470](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7470)) __Improve manual Size Mode handling in the editor__ 
* Switching from auto to manual Size Mode on sprites or GUI objects will now set the manual size from the image size.
* Corrected the editor bounding box of sprites with manual Size Mode.
