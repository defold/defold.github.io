## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#7967](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7967)) __Added option frustum_planes to render.draw()__ 
The flag is set as `render.FRUSTUM_PLANES_SIDES` as default, making sure only the 4 side planes of the frustum is used.
By specifying `frustum_planes = render.FRUSTUM_PLANES_ALL`, the user can make sure all 6 frustum planes are used.

Example:
```lua
render.draw(self.model_pred, { frustum = proj * view, frustum_planes = render.FRUSTUM_PLANES_ALL})
```

__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#7971](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7971)) __Renamed dmSpinlock::Init() to Create() and also added Destroy() function__ 
On some platforms, the spinlock needs to also be properly destroyed.
To make this more apparent, and also have good naming, we renamed the functions to Create()/Destroy().

__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#7972](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7972)) __Remove embedded builtins resources from release builds__ 
We've removed the system debug font as a default gui font. This will save some size in the final executable. This is a breaking change but it is likely to affect only a few users. If you are using gui text, and your gui scene doesn't have a font, the text will not show. If that is the case, then the fix is to add a font explicitly to your gui scene.

__NEW__: ([#7866](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7866)) __Custom vertex format support for ParticleFX components__ 
Particle FX nodes can now utilise the custom vertex formats previously added to sprites. This enables you to pass custom data from the editor into shader attributes when rendering particles.

__NEW__: ([#7961](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7961)) __Added sys.exists() for verifying the existence of a file or directory__ 
With this function it is possible for the user to check if a file exists before trying to load the file.

__FIX__: ([#7949](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7949)) __Fix issue when window (on Mac) opens without focus__ 
Fixed an issue when a window on Mac opens without focus. In such cases, the window doesn't react to most input events, and only double-click works.

__FIX__: ([#7681](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7681)) __Create depth / stencil buffers as textures for render targets__ 
Added support for creating render targets with depth buffers as textures, which enables you do bind them to a shader like a regular texture without the need to write the depth data to the color texture. To create a rendertarget with a depth texture, pass in the render.TEXTURE_BIT flag in the depth buffer parameters.

```lua
-- Creating the RT in a render script:
local color_params = {
    format = render.FORMAT_RGBA,
    width  = render.get_window_width(),
    height = render.get_window_height(),
}
local depth_params = {
    format = render.FORMAT_DEPTH,
    width  = render.get_window_width(),
    height = render.get_window_height(),
    flags  = render.TEXTURE_BIT -- this will create the depth buffer as a texture
}

self.my_render_target = render.render_target({
      [render.BUFFER_COLOR_BIT] = color_params,
      [render.BUFFER_DEPTH_BIT] = depth_params
  })

-- bind / enable the depth texture to a texture slot on a material:
render.enable_texture(0, self.my_render_target, render.BUFFER_DEPTH_BIT)
```

__FIX__: ([#7928](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7928)) __Fixed a fullscreen issue for newer macOS versions__ 
The issue was that on macOS Ventura, the fullscreen mode would not render anything as it got a window size of (0, 0).
We now detect this case and then use the window frame rectangle.

__FIX__: ([#7921](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7921)) __Add ability to ignore bundling for native extensions in `.defignore` __ 
Added ability to use `.defignore` to ignore native extensions when bundle in `bob.jar`.

__FIX__: ([#7851](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7851)) __Delete sound instance if stopped before play issued__ 
Fixed an issue where a delayed sound was stopped before it started playing.

__FIX__: ([#7827](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7827)) __Fixed non-Western character input not working on Windows and MacOS.__ 
It is now possible to input Chinese, Korean and other non-western language characters using a keyboard on Windows and macOS. The action table of the `on_input()` text event will contain the pressed key, just like for Western keyboard input.

__FIX__: ([#7969](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7969)) __Fix using `state` name as a temp resource name during the build process__ 
Fixed issue when `bob.jar` creates `state` file for its internal data. It makes it impossible to use this word as a name for a folder in the project.

__FIX__: ([#7987](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7987)) __Make sure that all the excluded collection detected even using local cache__ 
Fixed issue when using local cache may affect detection of the excluded collection proxies for LiveUpdate.

__FIX__: ([#7983](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7983)) __Use EngineLoader.wasm_size if response doesn't have Content-Length header__ 
dmloader.js will use EngineLoader.wasm_size if response doesn't have Content-Length header in setupWasmStreamAsync.

__FIX__: ([#7985](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7985)) __Fix for calling Unmount when removing a live update archive__ 
This fixes an issue where the memory and file handles of a live update archive would linger until the next reboot.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#7936](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7936)) __Automatically build SPIR-V shaders when using the Vulkan backend__ 
Improved the flow for using the Vulkan graphics backend in the engine:

* Bob will generate spir-v shaders automatically when a project is using an appmanifest file with vulkan link flags
* The editor will always generate spir-v shaders now in order to catch potential errors and pitfalls early
* The "output_spirv" project flag has now been deprecated, but not fully removed yet, so old projects will continue to work regardless

__NEW__: ([#7868](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7868)) __Show notifications about fetch library issues__ 
The editor will now show notifications about failed attempts to fetch libraries.

__NEW__: ([#7890](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7890)) __Add filtering to the editor Console__ 
This changeset adds a Filter function to the editor console. The editor supports 2 types of filters:
- inclusive filters, e.g. only show lines with text "my-app-subsystem" with `my-app-subsystem` filter
- exclusive filters, e.g. exclude lines with text "chatty-subsystem" with `!chatty-subsystem` filter

Additionally, you can use multiple filters simultaneously.

__NEW__: ([#7854](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7854)) __Add `gui.max_animation_count` propertin in `game.project`__ 
Now it's possible to specify count of animations in GUI component in `gam.project`->`gui.max_animation_count` (by default 1024).

__NEW__: ([#7914](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7914)) __Make editor load natives only for its platform__ 


__FIX__: ([#7950](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7950)) __Show right error when bundling__ 
Show right bundle error instead of `game/build/default/game.arci (No such file or directory)`

__FIX__: ([#7887](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7887)) __Separate glyph data from fonts__ 
Improved the font resource memory footprint by separating glyph data from common font settings such as material and shadow parameters that are generally not needed for the glyph data. Building a font file will not result in two resources on disk, one '.fontc' and one '.glyph_bankc' respectively. The glyph bank may be shared between two or more font files depending on font settings.

__FIX__: ([#7934](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7934)) __Less aggressive rounding of numeric values in the editor__ 
* Less aggressive rounding of numeric values in the editor.

__FIX__: ([#7904](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7904)) __Make `.image-view` styling more efficient__ 
Improve editor performance when scrolling the Assets pane

__FIX__: ([#144](https://github.com/defold/extension-spine/pull/144)) __Fix spine related crash in the editor when loading many spine animations at the same time__ 
This fixes an occasional editor crash when using the Spine extension.

__FIX__: ([#7908](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7908)) __Property editor fixes__ 
* Fixed some situations where the Property Editor would take longer to redraw after editing a property.
* Fixed a situation where a property could be reverted to its previous value shortly after an edit.
* Fixed a situation where duplicate undo steps could be created after committing a property change with the Enter key.

__FIX__: ([#7938](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7938)) __Make adb devices parsing more resilient__ 
APK installation on Android is now more resilient to different formats of `adb devices` output.

__FIX__: ([#7958](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7958)) __Send correct Content-Length HTTP headers in responses to engine HEAD resource requests__ 
* Fixed an issue where rebuilding the game project with the game already running would shut down the game with an error message.
