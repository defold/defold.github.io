## Engine
__NEW__: ([#8180](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8180)) __Make it possible to change column size in the web profiler__ 
Now it is possible to change a column size in the web profiler:

__NEW__: ([#8108](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8108)) __'default.render_script' refactoring reducing of the memory allocation and using of the Defold best practices.__ 
Now update() allocates 0 bytes and all the allocations and recalculations happens only by receiving external messages.

__NEW__: ([#8207](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8207)) __Show textures created with `gui.new_texture()` in resource profiler.__ 
Now textures created with `gui.new_texture()` will be listed in resource profiler altogether with the GUI resource name that owns it.

__NEW__: ([#7802](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7802)) __Generate resource graph on bundle.__ 
When building a project using the `bob.jar` command line tool a resource graph in json format will be saved as `build/default/game.graph.json`. The resource graph will list all resources included in the game archive, starting at the top level (project root) and following a parent-child hierarchy from the game.project file down through the bootstrap collection to each leaf resource. Example of a graph:

```json
[ {
  "path" : "/<AnonymousRoot>",
  "hexDigest" : null,
  "children" : [ "/main/main.collectionc", "/builtins/render/default.renderc", "/input/game.input_bindingc", "/builtins/input/default.gamepadsc", "/builtins/render/default.display_profilesc", "/builtins/scripts/debugger.luac" ]
}, {
  "path" : "/main/main.collectionc",
  "hexDigest" : "b876bb2748e96cb7ceab9deb9808f534c0b994cf",
  "children" : [ ]
}, {
  "path" : "/builtins/render/default.renderc",
  "hexDigest" : "62fcf66fed9988305fe48996f4d7693b2fac6e49",
  "children" : [ "/builtins/render/default.render_scriptc" ]
}, {
  "path" : "/builtins/render/default.render_scriptc",
  "hexDigest" : "51fe08bdca1d4a79e41bbda87bfa79a151b82c6f",
  "children" : [ ]
}, {
  "path" : "/input/game.input_bindingc",
  "hexDigest" : "9b525bf47b7a7a9c35ad9b07723421404c35dc0f",
  "children" : [ ]
}, {
  "path" : "/builtins/input/default.gamepadsc",
  "hexDigest" : "7c448d18992aefe1c184981f2bb057cf6429321f",
  "children" : [ ]
}]
```

__FIX__: ([#8132](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8132)) __Bundle process speeded up__ 
Now the Create Archive step during the bundling process 3 times faster. Also, build report generation speed increased drastically.

__FIX__: ([#8152](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8152)) __OpenGL renderer disables only enabled vertex attribute arrays__ 
OpenGL renderer disabled vertex arrays that had not been enabled. It didn't affect the visual side in any way, but the renderer made unnecessary OpenGL calls. Now the renderer disables only those vertex arrays that were enabled.

__FIX__: ([#8159](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8159)) __Added support for adding natively embedded resources at runtime__ 
This feature opens up for a native developer to provider certain resources at runtime.
It is not a replacement for the LiveUpdate feature, but rather a complement to it, allowing the developer to provide resources that come in an embedded form.

__FIX__: ([#8174](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8174)) __Improved handling of script init() errors__ 
We've improved handling of script `init()` errors.
For the initial setup
```
-go
--script1.script
----init()
----update()
--script2.script
----init()
----update()
```
if error happens in the `init()` function for the `script1.script` **old behavior** was
- the engine calls `script1.script->update()`
- the engine **doesn't** call `script2.script->init()`
- the engine calls `script2.script->update()`

As a result, the reason of the problem is an error in `script1.script->init()` which we see only once, but `script1.script->update()` and `script2.script->update()` may produce a ton of errors because scripts weren't initialized.

With this improvement, if error happens in the `script1.script->init()` function the engine behaves the following way:
- the engine **doesn't** call `script1.script->update()`
- the engine calls `script2.script->init()` and if this function doesn't have Lua errors:
  - the engine calls `script2.script->update()`

It makes script components more independent.
Also, it prevents situations when errors in `update()` function shadow the real reason of the problem in `init()` function.

__FIX__: ([#8187](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8187)) __Remove comments from Lua code when bundle project__ 
Remove all the comments from Lua code in all Lua files (`*.lua`, `*.script` etc) during the bundle process.

__FIX__: ([#8189](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8189)) __Make sure the resource system respects the liveupdate.enabled flag__ 
This fixes an issue where the liveupdate system wasn't fully disabled when the project setting was set to false (`liveupdate.enabled=0`)

__FIX__: ([#8197](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8197)) __Fix crash using wrong path in `*.set_prototype()`__ 
Fixed a a crash that happens because of using of a path without a `.`(dot) in it as the second parameter for `factory.set_prototype()` or `collectionfactory.set_prototype()`

__FIX__: ([#8213](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8213)) __Make sure that `action.screen_y` starts from 0 as well as `action.screen_x`__ 
Fixed inconsistency between `action.screen_y` which was in interval [1; window_heigh] and `action.screen_x` which was in interval [0; window_width - 1]. Now, both started from 0.

__FIX__: ([#8216](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8216)) __Bugfix for vulkan fullscreen support on OSX__ 


__FIX__: ([#8218](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8218)) __Updated build server to use MSVC 2022, XCode 15 and Clang 17__

It was long overdue to update the Windows sdk's, and we have now updated to MSVC 2022 (`14.37.32822`) and the latest windows 10 sdk (`10.0.20348.0`).
In doing so, we also had to update to Clang 17 (in order to cross compile windows on the Linux build server).

For extension/linux developers, be aware that this compiler will not link libraries that are not compiled with `-fPIC`/`-fPIE`, like the engine is.
So, if you see such a linker error, you will need to recompile or update your library.
For example, we've updated the [DefOS to 2.7.1](https://github.com/subsoap/defos/releases/tag/v2.7.1) to support Defold 1.6.2.

We've also updated to XCode 15. We'll update the macOS/iOS sdk's soon (whithin the next few releases).

## Editor
__NEW__: ([#8110](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8110)) __Use exp4j to evaluate math string__ 
You can now evaluate complex mathematical expressions such as `4 * (2 ^ 16)` in numeric text fields and they will be set to the result.

__FIX__: ([#8121](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8121)) __Make autocomplete less aggressive__ 
Auto-complete popup no longer appears on typing digits.

__FIX__: ([#8122](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8122)) __Fix non-working Z handles on the Scale Manipulator__ 
* The Scale Manipulator now works as expected when scaling along the Z axis, the XZ plane, and the YZ plane.

__FIX__: ([#8211](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8211)) __Disable Show/Hide Selected Objects command when nothing is selected__ 
The **Show/Hide Selected Objects** command is now disabled unless something is selected. Invoking it with no selection used to cause an error.

__FIX__: ([#8212](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8212)) __Remove icons from menu items in macOS menu bar__ 
* Removed broken icons from the menu bar on macOS.
* Replaced Undo and Redo menu item icons with high-resolution variants.

__FIX__: ([#8226](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8226)) __Open engine log file by double-clicking the error__
Double-clicking on the build error "For the full log, see /file/path/log.txt" will now open the error log file.
