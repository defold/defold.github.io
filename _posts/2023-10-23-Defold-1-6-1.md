## Engine
__NEW__: ([#8037](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8037)) __Paged atlas support for GUI__ 
GUI components can now use paged atlases and materials.

__NEW__: ([#8056](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8056)) __Bob doesn't build resources at all with `--exclude-archive` argument__ 
Fixes issue when Bob just doesn't include resources into the bundle when using  `--exclude-archive` but still builds everything. Now, Bob skips resource building because it's a waste of time in cases the user want a contenless bundle.

__FIX__: ([#7990](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7990)) __Removed the `skeleton` property from the `.animationset` resource.__ 
We've removed the `skeleton` property from the `.animationset` resource.
This allows us to better match animation names with bone names at runtime.

The root bone of a skeleton is now also always renamed to `root`, making it easier to use similar code in engine/scripting.

__FIX__: ([#8025](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8025)) __Use pixel coordinates for sprite attribute local space__ 
Fixed an issue where using the `local coordinate space` for a custom vertex stream used by a sprite produced coordinates in the `[-0.5, 0.5]` range. We now produce the data in pixel coordinates instead, which is already what the editor was doing prior.

__FIX__: ([#8054](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8054)) __Added atlas image rename functionality__ 
We've added the property `Rename patterns` to the Atlas resource type.
This will facilitate easier coupling of animations between multiple atlases, and is a first step towards multiple texture support for Sprites.

The property is a list of `,` separated patterns, where each pattern is a `=`separated string of the format `<src>=<dst>`.
Examples of Atlas imaged renaming
* Pattern: `_normal=` - An image of the name `hat_normal` -> `hat`.
* Pattern: `hat=cat,_normal=` - An image of the name `hat_normal` -> `cat`.

__FIX__: ([#8067](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8067)) __Use AL_BUFFERS_QUEUED to unqueue OpenAL buffers__ 
The OpenAL library for HTML5 seems to work a bit differently than the other platforms.
Instead of removing the processed buffers, we remove the queued buffers explicitly.

__FIX__: ([#8075](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8075)) __Cap HTML5 loading progress at 100%__ 
Make sure the HTML5 loader progress does not go beyond 100%

__FIX__: ([#8084](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8084)) __Rebuilt glslc for macOS 11__ 
The glslc for Intel macOS, was accidentally build for a newer macOS version.
It is now rebuilt for our minimum supported version macOS 11.

__FIX__: ([#8089](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8089)) __Updated spirv-cross/spirv-opt for macOS 11 for Intel machines__ 


__FIX__: ([#8087](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8087)) __Apply the scale from the `factory.create` arguments to the 3D trigger__ 
It turned out that the engine didn't apply the scale to the 3D trigger when an object was created from a factory or a collectionfactory. The pull request fixes the issue.

__FIX__: ([#8104](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8104)) __Fixed error reporting for Project.getResource()__ 
Fixed an issue where the error reporting for Project.getResource() wouldn't output which game project property was missing.

__FIX__: ([#8119](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/8119)) __Log listener crash__ 
We have an issue when unregistering log listeners, making it go out of bounds.

__FIX__: ([#8115](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8115)) __Added lipo tool for all host platforms__ 
This will allow bob.jar to bundle macOS on all platforms. An example use case it building on continuous integration servers.

__FIX__: ([#8038](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8038)) __Added support for multiple animated nodes in a .gltf file__ 

Previously, we assumed that the first model in the scene was the one that was used for skinning.
However, that didn't cover all the use cases, and instead we now render all the models in the scene.

Additionally, we now also list all the animations from a .gltf/.glb file when it's selected as the animation set for a `.model` component. Previously, it always only selected the longest animation in the file.
The previous behavior for `.animationset`'s is not changed, any animation files used in an animation set will only pick one animation (the longest), just as before.

Also, if there is a mesh in the model, that isn't skinned, but is a child to a bone, then that model will not be skinned at runtime, but get assigned a non-skinned material (if it didn't already have one)

Added `model.set_mesh_enabled()` and `model.get_mesh_enabled()` to control visibility of meshes within a scene.

__FIX__: ([#8134](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8134)) __Fix issue with window focus on macOS Sonoma (14.0)__ 

Fixed issue when on macOS Sonoma (14.0) game window started without focus on it.

__FIX__:  ([# 8114](https://github.com/defold/defold/issues/8114)) __Revert to old sound library for HTML5__ 

Due to some issues with the Emscripten OpenAL sound library, we decided to go back to our previous sound library for now.
We'll revisit the issues that are affected by this change.

__FIX__: ([# 8143](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8143)) __Fix issue when Component Counter doesn't take into account all Dynamic Prototype checkboxes__ 

Fixed issue when in some cases `Dynamic Prototype` checkbox isn't detected and collection does not switch mode to using of the `game.project` 's counters. 

## Editor
__NEW__: ([#8072](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8072)) __#5476: Toggle visibility of object using shortcut__ 
Support `Ctrl + E` to toggle show/hide objects.

__NEW__: ([#8085](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8085)) __#5990: Add quick help page__ 
Added a quick help page when no files are open.

__FIX__: ([#8107](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/8107)) __Escape underscore in menu__ 
Fixes an issue where '_' was not shows in the Recent Files menu.
