## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#7609](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7609)) __Add support for multiple liveupdate zip archives__ 
It is now possible to load and mount multiple resource archives using `liveupdate.add_mount(name, uri, priority, callback)`. A loaded mount can be removed using `liveupdate.remove_mount(name)` and a list of all mounted archives can be retrieved using `liveupdate.get_mounts()`. When the engine needs a resource it searches the list of mounted archives from the highest priority mount (priority is assigned when an archive is mounted) down to the base archive in search of the resource.

After mounting a .zip file, its resources are immediately available. There is no longer a need to reboot the game to access the new content. Resources in a mounted .zip file are no longer verified. It is up to the developer to verify the integrity of downloaded and mounted archives.

In order to facilitate this functionality the manifest and archive file format has been updated to version 5.  This means that existing .zip files won't load. The `liveupdate.ref` will be removed and as such the liveupdate workflow should trigger again.

A future improvement will be a way for developers to specify how liveupdate content is split into multiple archives when building. For now the excluded content is stored in a single archive and it is up to the developer to manually split the content into multiple archives.

__NEW__: ([#7800](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7800)) __Add option to avoid copying or cloning buffer in resource.set_buffer__ 
Added an argument table for `resource.set_buffer` with the optional flag `transfer_ownership` to set a buffer handle immediately on a resource instead of copying or cloning the incoming buffer to the destination buffer. This can be used to improve performance in some cases where heavy use of buffers will invoke lots of data copying. Similar to `resource.create_buffer`, to set the handle directly on a resource from an external lua buffer do this:

`resource.set_buffer(path, buf, { transfer_ownership = true })`

__NEW__: ([#7780](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7780)) __Bob.jar support for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) chips using JDK for arm64__ 
Now it is possible to use `bob.jar` with JDK for arm64 (Apple Silicon chips) on Mac.

__NEW__: ([#7803](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7803)) __Material constant array support for go.get/go.set__ 
Added support for setting constant array values from a table via `go.set`:

```
go.set("#sprite", "uniform_array", {
        vmath.vector4(1, 0, 0, 1),
        vmath.vector4(0, 1, 0, 1)
})
```

Calling `go.get` on the same target will return the entire array as a table as well:

```
go.get("#sprite", "uniform_array")
-- result: { vmath.vector4(1,0,0,1), vmath.vector4(0,1,0,1) }
```

__NEW__: ([#7788](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7788)) __Make sure that unloading of a gui component removes its dynamic textures__ 
Make sure that unloading a GUI component removes any dynamic textures associated with it to free up memory and prevent memory leaks.

Added `GuiDynamicTexturesSizeMb` counter to the profiler.

__NEW__: ([#7798](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7798)) __Error about syncfs is now a warning message__ 
This change will log a user friendly warning instead of an error in HTML5 builds if the mounted file system fails to sync.

__NEW__: ([#7772](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7772)) __Update all cameras in the focus stack__ 
Changed how the focus stack for cameras work. Instead of just updating the camera on the top of the stack, the engine now updates all cameras that have acquired focus via the message `msg.post(id, "acquire_camera_focus")`. This means that all cameras that have acquired focus will send `set_view_projection` messages to the render script. Each camera component can be identified in the render script by using the `sender` in the render script:

```
function on_message(self, message_id, message, sender)
    if message_id == hash("set_view_projection") then
        -- here, we use the sender.path to identify the camera, but you can combine path and fragment to create a more
        -- precise identifier for the camera
        self.my_cameras[sender.path] = { view = message.view, proj = message.proj }
    end
end
```

__NEW__: ([#7849](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7849)) __Get and set node materials from gui scripts__ 
GUI scripts have three new functions:

`gui.get_material(node)` - Gets the node material assigned in the editor (or an empty hash of "" if none assigned)
`gui.gui.set_material(node, material)` - Sets a material for a gui node from either material string or hash as specified in the list of materials in the GUI file
`gui.reset_material(node)` - Reset the material for a node to the default node specified in the GUI the node belongs to.

In addition to the GUI functions, you can also get and set materials in the gui via `go.get` and `go.set`:

```lua
go.get("#my_gui", "materials", { key = "my_custom_material_1" })
-- returns the hash of the resource, e.g hash("/path/to/material.materialc")
```

```lua
go.property("material_property", resource.material("/other_material.material"))
function init(self)
     -- this changes the material with key "my_custom_material1" to use a different material ("/other_material.material")
     go.set("#my_gui", "materials", self.material_property, { key = "my_custom_material_1" })
end
```

__NEW__: ([#7876](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7876)) __Use asynchronous build on the extender by default.__ 
Using of the asynchronous build process fixed an issue when some big extensions fail to build with `Internal Server Error`.

__FIX__: ([#7852](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7852)) __Set the correct previous state for xinput devices__ 
Fixed an issue where gamepads connected from the start doesn't trigger any 'connected' actions to the input system.

__FIX__: ([#7813](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7813)) __Sound stopped event__ 
Added a new message id for the sound component when a sound instance has been stopped via `sound.stop`. The new sound message id is called `sound_stopped` and will be passed into the lua callback specified when playing a sound.

__FIX__: ([#7812](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7812)) __Shader include with pragmas doesn't translate to ES3 correctly__ 
Fixed an issue where using header guards in shader includes produces the wrong output.

__FIX__: ([#7821](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7821)) __Fix issue with long comments in shaders__ 
Fixed issue when long comments in shaders can't be processed.

__FIX__: ([#7794](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7794)) __Fix profiler step blinking__ 
Fix the issue where the profiler blinks when the property Update Frequency other than 0.

__FIX__: ([#35](https://github.com/defold/extension-admob/pull/35)) __Set extension version as user agent__ 
Fixes #32

__FIX__: ([#7822](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7822)) __Fix issue when `wasm-web` arch can't be built without `js-web`__ 
Fixed an issue when Bob doesn't build the project for `wasm-web` architecture if the platform specified as `js-web`.

__FIX__: ([#7869](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7869)) __Make sure old LiveUpdate flow works fine__ 



## Editor
__NEW__: ([#7787](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7787)) __Add conditional breakpoints__ 
You can set a Lua condition that must evaluate to true for the breakpoint to be triggered. You can do it using new breakpoint popup that you can open by right-clicking on the breakpoint code editor area or pressing <kbd>Alt F9</kbd>.

__FIX__: ([#7793](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7793)) __Fix bug when debugger stops with an error if GUI text node contains newline__ 
Fix issue when debugger stops if a text node has a newline symbol and then debugger tries to get information about such a node on the breakpoint.

__FIX__: ([#7791](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7791)) __Don't replace all occurences of empty string__ 
The problem: when running `replace-all` with an empty string find term, the editor got stuck in an infinite loop finding the next occurrences.

 the editor no longer locks up executing the "Replace All" command in the code editor view when the search term is empty

__FIX__: ([#7825](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7825)) __Fix issue when `CMD+H` doesn't hide the editor on MacOS__ 
Fixed issue when `CMD+H`on MacOS shows Java About window instead of application hiding.
