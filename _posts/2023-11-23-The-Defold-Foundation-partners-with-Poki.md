_The Defold Foundation partners with Poki as a preferred partner for web game developers on Poki.com_

STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN - Nov. 23, 2023 - The Defold Foundation today announced a partnership with Poki as a preferred partner for web game developers on Poki.com. The Defold Foundation will work together with Poki to integrate the Defold game engine and services with the leading platform for web games.

_"Poki has been a favorite platform for Defold developers for a long time. With this partnership we get a chance to build an even stronger game engine for web games and introduce Defold to new developers on Poki"_, said Defold Product Owner Björn Ritzl. 

The Defold Foundation will work on general performance improvements to the web version of the Defold game engine and build new integrations specifically for the Poki platform and services. The new integrations and performance improvements will be developed iteratively and primarily released in sync with the monthly stable releases of the Defold game engine.

_"We’re super excited to kickstart this new partnership. Defold has been instrumental in powering some of the biggest hits on the web such as Monkey Mart (by Tinydobbins) and Cow Bay (by 7Spot Games). By teaming up it will become a lot easier for Defold developers to join the platform, reach millions of players, and utilize our set of game development tools"_, said Joep van Duinen, Head of Game Developer Operations & Partnerships at Poki.
