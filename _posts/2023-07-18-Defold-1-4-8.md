# Defold 1.4.8

The release contains a BREAKING CHANGE:

* [#7450](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7450) Upgrade to OpenJDK 17 
Note that this does not affect the average user building and releasing games, but if you do build the engine or tools from source or if you do use the bob.jar command line tools you need to update to JDK 17.

**A note on the version number**: According to our version naming scheme a breaking change should typically increase the second digit of the version, in this case from a 4 to a 5, but since this change doesn't affect the data formats or the average user for that matter we decided against going from 1.4.x to 1.5.0.

## Engine
__BREAKING CHANGE__: ([#7450](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7450)) __Upgrade to OpenJDK 17__ 
Breaking change: migrate editor and bob to JDK 17.

__NEW__: ([#7508](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7508)) __Custom vertex formats__ 
We have added support for passing custom data into vertices from a material or a sprite instance. While this functionality is similar to constants, using vertex attributes does not break batches. For example, the sprite component does not expose a color or tint property by default but with custom vertex attributes you can specify color values for specific sprites in your game.

The material editor can now be used to configure specific attributes for the associated vertex program.

The attributes are furthermore exposed for selected sprites in the outline, which then can be overridden per sprite component.

Currently, since this is the first iteration of this feature, it is only exposed to sprite components without any interaction from scripts but over time every component should be able to produce vertex data in the same way.

__NEW__: ([#7739](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7739)) __Determine unmapped gamepad at runtime__ 
A gamepad with no entry in the gamepads file will now report that it is unknown by setting the `gamepad_unknown` property in the gamepad action table in `on_input`.

__NEW__: ([#7762](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7762)) __Add view, projection and aspect_ratio as camera properties__ 
The view, projection and aspect ratio of a camera component are now available as properties on the component. The view and projection are read only using `go.get()`, while the aspect ratio can also be set using `go.set()`.

```lua
local view = go.get("#camera", "view")
local projection = go.get("#camera", "projection")
local aspect_ratio = go.get("#camera", "aspect_ratio")
go.set("#camera", "aspect_ratio", 1.4)
```

__NEW__: ([#7746](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7746)) __Expose version information to editor extensions__ 
Editor scripts now can access the following variables:
- `editor.version` — a version of Defold, e.g. `1.4.6`
- `editor.engine_sha1` — a SHA1 of Defold engine
- `editor.editor_sha1` — a SHA1 of Defold editor

__NEW__: ([#7747](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7747)) __Add gui.get_tree()__ 
Added `gui.get_tree(node)` to get a table with a node and all of its children, exactly like `gui.clone_tree()` does, but without creating any new nodes.

```
local foo = gui.get_node("foo")
local tree = gui.get_tree(foo)
for id,node in pairs(tree) do
    print(id, node)
end
```

__FIX__: ([#7766](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7766)) __Particle effects crashfix__ 
Fixed a crash that occasionally happens a script is removed that started playing a particlefx with a state change callback.

__FIX__: ([#134](https://github.com/defold/extension-spine/pull/134)) __Fix crash when skeleton doesn't have its version__ 
(PR https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes/pull/2270 merged)

__FIX__: ([#7544](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7544)) __Bundle only specified architectures in HTML5 builds__ 
HTML5 bundles always included both asm.js and wasm binaries, even if the `--architectures` option specified only one architecture. This change makes sure to only include the specified architecture, and in the case when wasm is not included the engine loader will not attempt to load or stream it.

__FIX__: ([#7748](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7748)) __Show model's Vertex Count in profiler for models in Local Vector Space__ 
Fix issue when models with Vector Space `Local` in its material aren't taken into account by the profiler.

__FIX__: ([#7760](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7760)) __Make sure to call the gui flipbook animation callback on single frame animations__ 
Since Defold 1.3.1 single images in an atlas are not treated as implicit flipbook animations in a gui. This change saves resources, but it also has the unfortunate side-effect that calling `gui.play_flipbook()` on a single image will not invoke the callback if one is passed to `gui.play_flipbook()`.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#7606](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7606)) __Individual materials for GUI nodes__ 
GUIs now has a list of materials that can be assigned to individual nodes, similar to textures, particles and fonts. If no material has been set on a node, the default GUI node material will be used.

Note:  Assigning separate materials will break batching in the same manner as the regular GO world!

__FIX__: ([#7744](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7744)) __Implement lazy loading of the debugged app state__ 
How it's implemented:
1. EDN conversion in `edn.lua` is split into 2 parts: `analyze` and `serialize`. Analyze step collects a graph of reference data structures (tables, scripts) up to a certain depth, and returns them along with "edge refs" — a map from pointer string to a reference data structure referenced by the collected subgraph, but will not be serialized. Those are the references the editor might ask about. Serialize step does not use edge refs, but it does use the subgraph returned by `analyze` to serialize Lua VM objects into EDN.
2. `mobdebug.lua` tracks a cache of edge refs created by `analyze` step. This cache is written into when we serialize something to EDN when the debugger state is "suspended", and it's cleared when the execution resumes (i.e. on `RUN`, `STEP`, `OVER`, `OUT` and `DONE`). It also adds a new `REF` command that, given an edge reference pointer string (the editor has those), responds with another Lua VM object subgraph.
3. The editor changes `LuaStructure` definition to include a connection to `DebugSession`. Then, when something tries to access the contents of a reference that is unknown to the `LuaStructure`, it loads it from the debugged game using the `REF` command.


Debugger is now more responsive when debugging games with a lot of state.

__FIX__: ([#7770](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7770)) __Update JavaFX__ 
editor no longer crashes when dragging multiple items at the same time.
