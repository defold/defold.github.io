## Engine
__NEW__: ([#7714](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7714)) __Add `leading`, `tracking` and `line_break` properties for label component.__ 
Now it is possible to get/set `leading`, `tracking` and `line_break`properties for a label component:
```
local leading = go.get("#label", "leading")
leading = leading * 1.2
go.set("#label", "leading", leading)
go.animate("#label", "leading", go.PLAYBACK_LOOP_PINGPONG, 2, go.EASING_INSINE, 2)

local tracking = go.get("#label", "tracking")
tracking = tracking * 1.2
go.set("#label", "tracking", tracking)
go.animate("#label", "tracking", go.PLAYBACK_LOOP_PINGPONG, 2, go.EASING_INSINE, 2)

local line_break = go.get("#label", "line_break")
go.set("#label", "line_break", false)
```

__NEW__: ([#7669](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7669)) __Sprite animation frame count__ 
Added the new property `frame_count` to sprite components to get the current running animations frame count:
`go.get("#sprite", "frame_count")`

Note that if you play a flipbook animation via `sprite.play_flipbook`, it will not be played until the next frame so retrieving the frame count at this time will get the value of the old animation that was previously playing.

__FIX__: ([#7625](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7625)) __Cubemap + WebGL float type fixes__ 
Fixed several issues with creating cubemap textures with float types. Creating cubemaps from scripts now also works correctly for all graphics adapters.

__FIX__: ([#7674](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7674)) __Check if the handle is correct when calling timer.get_info__ 
A bug fix for calling timer.get_info with a handle to a cancelled timer.

__FIX__: ([#7637](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7637)) __Added support for cyclic detection when serializing a table__ 


__FIX__: ([#7657](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7657)) __Fix uploading basis compressed texture array data__ 
Fixed an issue with uploading basis compressed textures to a texture array, which is primarily used for paged atlases in the engine.

__FIX__: ([#7659](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7659)) __Spir-V pipeline improvements__ 
Improved the SPIR-V shader pipeline:
* Better error feedback when shader inputs and outputs mismatch during the build process
* Removed redundancy when producing shader resource bindings since we now run optimisation passes on the SPIR-V source
* Output name hashes for shader bindings instead of doing it in runtime

__FIX__: ([#7660](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7660)) __Check uniform buffer limits when creating vulkan shaders__ 
When a shader exceeds the number of texture samplers and uniform buffers on the Vulkan adapter we show a bit more helpful error message instead of crashing the engine.

__FIX__: ([#7670](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7670)) __Fix issue with components counter in some cases__ 
Fix the issue that occurs when there are multiple instances of the same object containing a factory, which causes the component counter to break.

__FIX__: ([#6912](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/6912)) __Added engine support for arm64 macOS__
Bob.jar will now accept arm64-macos as an architecture. By default, it will generate both x86_64-macos and x86_64-macos.
Bob.jar can now also be run under an arm64 terminal and use corresponding arm binaries.
The editor macOS bundle dialog has also been updated to support dual architectures.
There is still work left to do
* The editor itself still is an x86_64 executable
* Build'n'run still uses the x86_64 macOS engine

__FIX__: ([#7734](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7735)) Fix broken `Evaluate Lua` functionality in Lua Debugger
Fix issue when Lua Debugger hangs after using `Evaluate Lua` functionality.


## Editor
__NEW__: ([#7642](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7642)) __Use `:textual?` flag for Search in Files__ 
Technical note: we now look at `:textual?` flag of a resource type to determine if a resource without save data might be textual.



We no longer search through `.glb` files when performing Search in Files.

__NEW__: ([#7686](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7686)) __Implement Goto Definition using LSP__ 
editor now uses running LSP servers for going to definitions of code files. The action is bound to <kbd>F12</kbd> shortcut. You need [Lua language server](https://github.com/defold/lua-language-server) running by the editor for this feature to work.

__NEW__: ([#7692](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7692)) __Implement Find References__ 
UX note: I thought that showing a notification with a button to read more about LSPs is better than showing a greyed-out menu item with no clarification, so I decided to always make the LSP actions active.

 The editor now supports finding references using LSP, with the command assigned to a <kbd>Shift F12</kbd> shortcut. The Go to Definition and Find References commands are more discoverable now — we show them in the Edit menu bar. We now also point the user toward the LSP post on the forum in case they try to use these commands without a language server dependency.

__NEW__: ([#7673](https://github.com/defold/defold/pull/7673)) __Install and launch APKs after the Android bundle__
