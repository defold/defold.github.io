		<h4>Web Monetization</h4>
		<p><a href="https://webmonetization.org/" target='_blank'>Web Monetization</a> is an open technology that allows someone viewing a webpage or playing a web game to stream very small payments (micropayments) to the creator in real time. It is an exciting new and non-intrusive way for game developers to monetize their web games while at the same time offering premium content to their paying players.</p>

		<p>Web Monetization is being <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/proposal-web-monetization-a-new-revenue-model-for-the-web/3785" target='_blank'>proposed as a W3C standard</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://interledger.org/" target='_blank'>Interledger</a> protocol which is an open, neutral protocol for transferring money of any currency, including digital currencies such as Bitcoin.</p>

		<h4>Judging</h4>
		<p>The submitted games will be judged by a panel of judges. The games will be judged based on three criteria:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fun - Is the game fun?</li>
			<li>Web Monetization - How well does the game integrate and use Web Monetization?</li>
			<li>Theme - How well does the game incorporate and interpret the theme?</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The winners will be announced two weeks after the game jam has ended. The announcement will be made here, on <a href="https://itch.io/jam/the-web-monetization-challenge-2020" target='_blank'>itch.io</a> and on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/defold" target='_blank'>Twitter</a>.</p>

		</div>
		<h4>Submissions</h4>
		<p>Games should be submitted as .zip archives (with an index.html and all files needed to run the game) and as a link to a playable version of your game with Web Monetization enabled on the page. We are unfortunately not able to use the itch.io to host the playable games as itch.io loads HTML5 games in an iframe which prevents a Web Monetization enabled browser from detecting the payment pointer and your game from detecting a paying player.</p>
