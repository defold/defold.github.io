This example shows how to build a simple first-person controller for a 3D scene. You can look around with the mouse and move on the XZ plane using the keyboard (WSAD).

## What you'll learn?
- How to implement a FPP camera with mouse to look around.
- How to lock/unlock the mouse cursor for immersive camera control.
- How to move on a simple XZ plane logic with keyboard input.
