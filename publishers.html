	<h5>Stable and well tested</h5>

	<p>Defold is actively developed, with a new release every month. Each release goes through a two week beta period where the engine is tested by our global community of developers. This approach with short development cycles help us catch issues early, which in turn results in short turnaround time for fixes and a stable and well tested game engine at all times.</p> 

	<p>We also work closely with platform holders such as Google and Apple to ensure that the engine and tools are always kept up-to-date with the latest OS versions. Defold is in fact one of the few game engines <a href="https://developer.android.com/games/engines/defold/defold-configure">recommended by Google for Android game development</a>.</p>


	<h5>Technical Support</h5>

	<p>We can assist you with technical issues or questions that may arise during or after the publishing processs. Please <a href="mailto:business@defold.com">reach out to us</a> to discuss which level of support you need!</p>
