# Game

The game module contains various functionality related to the game.


## Game settings

The settings table contains:

* `muteAudio` — mute game audio when `true`. This setting must take priority over the game's own audio preference.
* `disableChat` — disable in-game chat when `true`, if the game provides chat.

Read and apply the initial settings when the game starts, then register a listener to react to changes:

```lua
local function apply_game_settings(settings)
  set_game_audio_muted(settings.muteAudio)
  set_chat_enabled(not settings.disableChat)
end

local settings = crazygames.get_game_settings()
if settings then
  apply_game_settings(settings)
end

crazygames.add_settings_change_listener(function(self, updated_settings)
  apply_game_settings(updated_settings)
end)
```

The Defold integration supports one settings listener; registering another replaces the previous listener. Remove it when it is no longer needed:

```lua
crazygames.remove_settings_change_listener()
```

For local testing, append `?muteAudio=true` or `?disableChat=true` to the game URL. CrazyGames requires `muteAudio` support for a full HTML5 implementation. See the [CrazyGames Game Settings documentation](https://docs.crazygames.com/sdk/game/#game-settings).



## Happy time

The `happytime()` method can be called on various player achievements (beating a boss, reaching a high score, etc.). It makes the website celebrate (for example by launching some confetti). There is no need to call this when a level is completed or an item is obtained.

```lua
crazygames.happytime()
```


## Gameplay start/stop

CrazyGames provide functions that enable them to track when and how users are playing your games. These can be used to ensure their site does not perform resource intensive actions while a user is playing.

The `gameplay_start()` function has to be called whenever the player starts playing or resumes playing after a break (menu/loading/achievement screen, game paused, etc.).

The `gameplay_stop()` function has to be called on every game break (entering a menu, switching level, pausing the game, ...) don't forget to call `gameplay_start()` when the gameplay resumes

```lua
-- player pauses the game
crazygames.gameplay_stop()
-- player resumes the game
crazygames.gameplay_start()
```


## Game loading start/stop

CrazyGames provide functions that enable them to track when and how long the loading of your game takes.

The `loading_start()` function has to be called whenever you start loading your game.

The `loading_stop()` function has to be called when the loading is complete and eventually the gameplay starts.

Note: The `loading_start()` and `loading_stop()` are called automatically when the game is loading the first time. You only need to call the functions if you are loading additional assets after the game has started.


```lua
-- next level's assets are loading now
crazygames.loading_start()
-- assets are loaded
crazygames.loading_stop()
```


## Room data

For multiplayer games, report the room the player is currently in so CrazyGames can offer platform-level joining and invitations. A room update can contain any combination of `roomId`, `isJoinable`, and `inviteParams`; only the supplied fields are updated.

```lua
-- The player enters a room. Room IDs must be unique across regions.
crazygames.update_room({
  roomId = "123-eu",
})

-- Other players can now join. These parameters are passed to joining players.
crazygames.update_room({
  isJoinable = true,
  inviteParams = {
    roomName = "123",
    region = "eu",
  },
})

-- The room is full.
crazygames.update_room({ isJoinable = false })

-- The player leaves the room.
crazygames.left_room()
```

When a game starts from an invitation, retrieve all parameters with `get_invite_params()`. It returns `nil` if the game was not opened from an invite link.

```lua
local invite_params = crazygames.get_invite_params()
if invite_params then
  join_room(invite_params.roomName, invite_params.region)
end
```

If the game is already running when the player accepts an invitation, the join-room listener receives the new invite parameters. The Defold integration supports one listener; registering another replaces the previous listener.

```lua
crazygames.add_join_room_listener(function(self, invite_params)
  join_room(invite_params.roomName, invite_params.region)
end)

-- Remove the listener when it is no longer needed.
crazygames.remove_join_room_listener()
```

See the [CrazyGames Room Data documentation](https://docs.crazygames.com/sdk/game/#room-data) for platform behavior and multiplayer requirements.


## Invite link

This feature lets you share the CrazyGames version of your game to the players and invite them to join a multiplayer game. You can call `invite_link()` with a map of parameters that correspond to your game or game room.

```lua
local link = crazygames.invite_link({
  roomId = 12345,
  param1 = "value1",
  param2 = "value2",
})
```


## Invite button

> **Deprecated:** CrazyGames has replaced the invite button with [Room Data](https://docs.crazygames.com/sdk/game/#room-data). This extension retains the invite-button methods for compatibility with existing games; new integrations should use `update_room()` and `left_room()`.

This feature allows you to display a button in the game footer, that opens a popup containing the invite link. The returned link is similar to the link returned from Invite link.

The invite button should only be used to invite players to a multiplayer gaming session. Please avoid using it for other use cases, such as a "Share" button for example, as this may lead to delayed submission check or even game rejection.

You can show the invite button like this:

```lua
crazygames.show_invite_button({
  roomId = 12345,
  param1 = "value1",
  param2 = "value2",
})
```

Don't forget to hide the invite button when it is no longer necessary:

```lua
crazygames.hide_invite_button()
```


## Retrieving invite link parameters

The invite link parameters can be retrieved with the help of the `get_invite_param()` function, for example:

```lua
-- returns either a string or nil if the parameter is missing
local room_id = crazygames.get_invite_param("roomId")
```
