# Installation
To use CrazyGames SDK in your Defold project, add a version of the CrazyGames SDK extension to your `game.project` dependencies from the list of available [Releases](https://github.com/defold/extension-crazygames/releases). Find the version you want, copy the URL to ZIP archive of the release and add it to the project dependencies.

Select `Project->Fetch Libraries` once you have added the version to `game.project` to download the version and make it available in your project.

# Modules

The SDK has the following modules:

* [`ad`](ad) - display video ads, detect adblockers
* [`banner`](banner) - display banners
* [`game`](game) - various game events
* [`user`](user) - for interacting with the currently logged in user
* [`data`](data) - store user data that persists across devices


## Example

[Refer to the example project](https://github.com/defold/extension-crazygames/blob/master/example/crazygames.gui_script) to see a complete example of how the integration works.


## Quality Assurance Tool

You can use the CrazyGames QATool to test your SDK implementation. You can use the [standalone version](https://developer.crazygames.com/qatool) without creating a submission. With the QATool you can:

* Run your game as it would on Crazygames.
* Try out the main different resolutions that we use on the site.
* Test all the SDK features that you implemented and get feedback about it.

## Source code
