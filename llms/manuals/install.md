# Installing Defold {#manuals:install}

Installation of the Defold editor is quite straightforward. Download the version built for your operating system, extract it and copy the software to a suitable location.

## Downloading

Go to the [Defold download page](https://defold.com/download/) where you will find Download buttons for macOS, Windows and Linux (Ubuntu):

## Installation

Installation on macOS
: The downloaded file is a DMG image containing the program.

  1. Locate the file "Defold-x86_64-macos.dmg" and double click it to open the image.
  2. Drag the application "Defold" to the "Applications" folder link.

  To start the editor, open your "Applications" folder and `double click` the file "Defold".

Installation on Windows
: The downloaded file is a ZIP archive that needs to be extracted:

  1. Locate the archive file "Defold-x86_64-win32.zip", `press and hold` (or `right-click`) the folder, select *Extract All*, and then follow the instructions to extract the archive to a folder named "Defold".
    2. Move the folder "Defold" to your preferred location (e.g. `D:\\Defold`). You should not move Defold to `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\` or `C:\\Program Files\\` since this will prevent the editor from updating.

  To start the editor, open the folder "Defold" and `double click` the file "Defold.exe".

Installation on Linux
: The downloaded file is a ZIP archive that needs to be extracted:

  1. From a terminal, locate the archive file "Defold-x86_64-linux.zip" unzip it to a target Directory called "Defold".
     ```bash
     $ unzip Defold-x86_64-linux.zip -d Defold
     ```

  To start the editor, change directory to where you extracted the application, then run the `Defold` executable, or `double click` it on your desktop.
  ```bash
  $ cd Defold
  $ ./Defold
  ```

  There is a helper to install a desktop entry on the `Help > Create Desktop Entry` menu.

  If you run into any problems starting the editor, opening a project or running a Defold game please refer to the [Linux section of the FAQ](https://defold.com/faq/faq#linux-questions).
