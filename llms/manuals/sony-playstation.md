# Game development for PlayStation®4 and PlayStation®5 consoles  {#manuals:sony-playstation}
Due to licensing restrictions, access to Defold versions with support for development on PS4 and PS5 is not included in the standard version of Defold. In order to get access to versions of Defold with PS4 and PS5 game development support you need to be registered as a licensed PS4 and PS5 game developer respectively.

## Registering as developer for PS4 and PS5 game development
You can register as a game developer for PS4™ and PS5™ game development from the [PlayStation™ Partners page](https://register.playstation.net/partnership)

When you have been approved by Sony you will get access to the Playstation 5 DevNet and/or Playstation 4 DevNet. Navigate to Development > Tools & Middleware > Tools & Middleware directory > Defold. Click the ‘Confirm Status’ button.

## FAQ
#### Q: Do I need to install additional tools to build for consoles?

A: You will be able to create application bundles from the editor and command line tools. Information about how to test on PlayStation®4, PlayStation®5 and Nintendo Switch hardware will be provided to you when you are given access to the respective platforms.

#### Q: Is it still easy to use a single code base if I decide to also target consoles?

A: Yes, all of the standard Defold API functions are available also for the console platforms. In addition to the standard functionality you will also have access to a couple of PlayStation®4, PlayStation®5 and Nintendo Switch specific functions, but in general the code should be able to remain exactly the same across multiple platforms.
