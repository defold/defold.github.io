#### Q: Do I need to install additional tools to build for consoles?

A: You will be able to create application bundles from the command line tools. Information about how to test on PlayStation®4 and Nintendo Switch hardware will be provided to you when you are given access to the respective platforms.


#### Q: Is it still easy to use a single code base if I decide to also target consoles?

A: Yes, all of the standard Defold API functions are available also for the console platforms. In addition to the standard functionality you will also have access to a couple of PlayStation®4 and Nintendo Switch specific functions, but in general the code should be able to remain exactly the same across multiple platforms.
