# Defold

> Defold is a free, source-available game engine for 2D and 3D games across mobile, desktop, web, and consoles. It uses Lua for scripting, and supports native extensions in C++ and other languages via the SDK.

Key notes:

- Lua is the primary scripting language for game logic and tooling.
- Native extensions can be written in C++ and bound to Lua; they can also wrap other languages or SDKs.
