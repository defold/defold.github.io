<h3>Corporate partnerships</h3>
<p>Our Corporate partnership program lets corporations and organizations fund development of specific functionality in or around the Defold product. Members of the Corporate partnership program will receive dedicated development time from the Defold Team to use on specific projects or features of your choice.</p>

<p>In addition to the dedicated development time, corporate partners will get prominent mentions on the Defold site, in blog posts and newsletters and in the Defold editor. Corporate partners will also get invitations to participate at special events hosted by the foundation.</p>

<p>We offer the following levels of corporate partnership:</p>
