# Unity LevelPlay extension for Defold

This extension provides an object-based Lua API for Unity LevelPlay mediation on Android and iOS. It follows the SDK 9 lifecycle: initialize the SDK, create an ad object with an ad-unit ID, then explicitly load and show that object.

## Installation

Add a released archive to the **Dependencies** field in `game.project`:

```text
https://github.com/defold/extension-levelplay/archive/refs/tags/<version>.zip
```

Choose a version from [Releases](https://github.com/defold/extension-levelplay/releases), replace `<version>`, then select **Project → Fetch Libraries**.

## Project configuration

Add a `[levelplay]` section and enable only the adapters used by your dashboard configuration. The example intentionally enables only Unity Ads:

```ini
[levelplay]
unity_ads_android = 1
unity_ads_ios = 1
ios_tracking_usage_description = Your data will be used to provide a more relevant advertising experience.
```

Available adapter prefixes are:

```text
applovin, aps, bidmachine, bigo, chartboost, dt_exchange, admob,
hyprmx, inmobi, liftoff, line, meta, mintegral, mobilefuse, moloco,
ogury, pangle, pubmatic, smaato, superawesome, unity_ads, verve, vk,
yandex, yso
```

Append `_android` or `_ios` to a prefix. Tencent is available as
`tencent_ios`. When enabling AdMob on iOS, also set `admob_ios_appid`.
The current Android Google Mobile Ads SDK obtains the app ID from your
LevelPlay dashboard rather than Android manifest metadata.

Amazon Publisher Services must be configured with its app ID so the extension
can initialize APS before LevelPlay:

```ini
[levelplay]
aps_android = 1
aps_android_app_id = your-aps-android-app-id
aps_ios = 1
aps_ios_app_id = your-aps-ios-app-id
```

The Android template includes Google advertising identifier dependencies and
the `AD_ID` permission by default. Set `android_google_identifiers = 0` for an
Amazon build or a primarily child-directed build that must omit these
identifiers. The disabled path also emits the Android manifest removal rule so
an enabled adapter cannot merge `AD_ID` back in. Set COPPA and all
network-required device-ID opt-outs before initialization.

The Mintegral switch currently selects its verified overseas SDK and repository,
not the separate China artifact family. Smaato and Meta network-security
requirements, APS manifest components and Kotlin runtime, and Mintegral's
RecyclerView dependency are generated automatically.

Follow the current network integration guide for dashboard setup and any
network-specific privacy metadata. For Chartboost, set its required COPPA value
before initialization:

```lua
levelplay.set_metadata("CHARTBOOST_COPPA", is_child_directed and "YES" or "NO")
```

The extension requires Android API 24 or newer and targets API 36. Its iOS
native templates set the deployment target to iOS 15, matching the current
Defold iOS toolchain.

### iOS attribution and transport configuration

The iOS template always enables the transport setting required by the mediated
SDKs, the LevelPlay attribution endpoint, Unity's current primary
SKAdNetwork ID, and the primary IDs recorded in this repository for each
enabled adapter.

Apple requires the complete current set for every network your application
uses. Partner-, account-, region-, and app-specific SKAdNetwork and
AdAttributionKit identifiers cannot be inferred from an adapter switch. Before
shipping, collect the complete lists from Unity's iOS network guides and each
enabled partner. Supply a custom project `Info.plist` through Defold's **iOS →
Info.plist** project setting containing the complete `SKAdNetworkItems` list;
Defold merges that base manifest with this extension's iOS manifest. Review the
merged `Info.plist` in the final IPA. See Defold's
[manifest merge documentation](https://defold.com/manuals/extensions-manifest-merge-tool/)
and Unity's
[SKAdNetwork guidance](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/levelplay/sdk/ios/skadnetwork-id-manager).

## App keys and ad-unit IDs

An **app key** identifies the application and is passed only to `levelplay.init()`.

An **ad-unit ID** identifies one dashboard ad unit and is passed to `create_interstitial_ad()`, `create_rewarded_ad()`, or `create_banner_ad()`. An app key and an ad-unit ID are not interchangeable. Each ad object retains its own ad-unit ID, listener, loading state, and integer handle.

The repository example uses Unity's official demo credentials:

| Platform | App key | Interstitial | Rewarded | Banner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Android | `25b63cf85` | `h3xw38h9214adgxo` | `syz3d8ekts22q0or` | `4fpetq4lhe5lsw3e` |
| iOS | `25c43a4a5` | `obg6ohwts3y690ks` | `l1quzz1xmmdhw5er` | `xc2bsuntn9ea734t` |

Replace every value with credentials from your own LevelPlay dashboard before release.

## Privacy before initialization

`levelplay.set_gdpr_consent()` does not display a consent form or collect a
choice. It passes a Boolean choice to LevelPlay, which shares it with mediated
networks whose adapters support the consent API. It also does not read values
stored privately by another Defold extension.

Whether you need to call it depends on the consent platform:

- With Google UMP, or a compatible CMP that supports Google's Additional
  Consent specification, LevelPlay SDK 7.7.0 and newer automatically reads and
  shares the consent signals, so you normally do not need to pass the same
  choice through `set_gdpr_consent()`. Configure the applicable custom ad
  partners listed by Unity in the CMP's Additional Consent setup.
- With a custom or other external consent extension, retrieve the user's final
  choice from that extension and call `set_gdpr_consent()` before `init()`.
  Merely showing a consent form or saving the result in the other extension is
  not enough.
- With another IAB TCF CMP, registered TCF vendors can read the TCF string.
  Follow the CMP's instructions for non-registered vendors and pass the choice
  to LevelPlay when the CMP does not provide Google Additional Consent support.

See Unity's official [LevelPlay legal resources](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/levelplay/platform/legal-resources)
and its GDPR compliance page for the current CMP requirements and supported
mediated networks.

For the custom or external consent path, collect privacy choices in your own
consent flow and apply them before initialization. The sample values below are
placeholders, not a consent-management implementation:

```lua
levelplay.set_gdpr_consent(user_granted_gdpr_consent)
levelplay.set_ccpa(user_opted_out_of_sale_or_sharing)
levelplay.set_coppa(is_child_directed)
-- When Meta Audience Network is enabled:
levelplay.set_meta_limited_data_use(use_meta_ldu, 0, 0)

local function initialize_after_tracking(status)
    -- Meta has a separate iOS flag; call this before init when Meta is enabled.
    levelplay.set_meta_advertiser_tracking(
        status == levelplay.TRACKING_STATUS_AUTHORIZED
    )
    levelplay.init(APP_KEY, user_id)
end

local status = levelplay.get_tracking_authorization_status()
if status == levelplay.TRACKING_STATUS_NOT_DETERMINED then
    -- In MSG_TRACKING, call initialize_after_tracking(message.event).
    levelplay.request_tracking_authorization()
else
    initialize_after_tracking(status)
end
```

For GDPR, `true` means consent was granted. For CCPA and related US privacy signals, `true` means the user opted out of sale or sharing. For COPPA, `true` flags the user as child-directed. Read Unity's current regulation settings for [Android](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/levelplay/sdk/android/regulation-advanced-settings) and [iOS](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/levelplay/sdk/ios/regulation-advanced-settings), obtain legal guidance appropriate to your application, and set network-specific metadata before `init()` when required.

Meta's Limited Data Use setting is not represented by LevelPlay's scalar
privacy methods, so `set_meta_limited_data_use()` invokes the enabled Meta SDK
directly. Pass `0, 0` to let Meta determine country and state, or pass the
codes required by Meta's current documentation.
`set_meta_advertiser_tracking()` applies Meta's separate iOS tracking flag.
Both functions return `false` if Meta is not linked or initialization has
already started.

On iOS, request App Tracking Transparency before `init()` if mediation
partners should receive the IDFA. The result is delivered through
`MSG_TRACKING`; `get_tracking_authorization_status()` returns the current
state. Provide a clear `ios_tracking_usage_description` in `game.project`.
When Meta's mixed-audience treatment applies, set its documented
`Meta_Mixed_Audience` metadata value before initialization as well.

## Initialization and ad creation

Install one callback before initializing. Create ad objects only after `EVENT_INIT_SUCCEEDED`:

```lua
local interstitial
local rewarded
local banner

local function levelplay_callback(self, message_id, message)
    if message_id == levelplay.MSG_INIT then
        if message.event == levelplay.EVENT_INIT_SUCCEEDED then
            interstitial = levelplay.create_interstitial_ad(INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID)
            rewarded = levelplay.create_rewarded_ad(REWARDED_AD_UNIT_ID)
            banner = levelplay.create_banner_ad(BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID, {
                size = levelplay.BANNER_SIZE_ADAPTIVE,
                position = levelplay.BANNER_POSITION_BOTTOM,
                respect_safe_area = true,
            })
        else
            print("LevelPlay init failed", message.error_code, message.error_message)
        end
    end
end

levelplay.set_callback(levelplay_callback)
levelplay.init(APP_KEY, "example-user")
```

Initialization reports both success and failure. Do not create or load ad objects merely because `init()` was called.

### Ad objects, ad units, and placements

Create an ad object once after initialization and reuse it throughout the
session. The object is bound to the **ad-unit ID** supplied to its
`create_*_ad()` function. It owns that ad unit's listener, loading state, and
handle.

Creation parameters are not per load or show. They remain attached to the
returned handle for its entire lifetime:

| Parameter | Applies to | When supplied | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ad_unit_id` | All formats | First argument to `create_*_ad()` | Fixed for the object |
| `bid_floor` | All formats | Second argument for interstitial/rewarded; banner `options` field | Fixed for the object and every load it performs |
| `size`, `position`, `respect_safe_area` | Banner | Banner `options` fields | Fixed for the banner view |
| `placement` | Banner | Banner `options` field | Fixed for the banner and used for reporting |
| `placement` | Interstitial/rewarded | Optional argument to `show_*_ad()` | Selected separately for each impression |

`bid_floor` is the minimum eCPM in USD. Omit it to use the dashboard and
mediation defaults. If an ad-unit ID, bid floor, or banner creation option must
change, destroy the handle and create a new object. Do not recreate an object
merely to load or show another impression with the same configuration.

For example, the optional bid floor is a positional argument for fullscreen
objects but a field in the banner options table:

```lua
local interstitial = levelplay.create_interstitial_ad(
    INTERSTITIAL_AD_UNIT_ID,
    1.25 -- Minimum eCPM in USD for every load by this object.
)

local rewarded = levelplay.create_rewarded_ad(
    REWARDED_AD_UNIT_ID,
    1.25
)

local banner = levelplay.create_banner_ad(BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID, {
    size = levelplay.BANNER_SIZE_ADAPTIVE,
    position = levelplay.BANNER_POSITION_BOTTOM,
    placement = "HomeScreen", -- Reporting placement for this banner object.
    bid_floor = 1.25,
    respect_safe_area = true,
})
```

See Unity's
[price-floor documentation](https://docs.unity.com/grow/levelplay/sdk/unity/additional-settings)
for its current auction behavior.

A **placement** is not an object and is not created by the extension. It is an
optional dashboard name passed when showing a ready fullscreen ad. Placements
let the same ad-unit object report different presentation points and apply
placement-specific rewards, pacing, and capping:

```lua
levelplay.show_interstitial_ad(interstitial, "LevelComplete")
levelplay.show_rewarded_ad(rewarded, "DoubleCoins")
```

Interstitial and rewarded objects support multiple load/show cycles. One
successful load provides one fullscreen impression, so reload the same object
after the previous ad closes:

```text
create once
  → load
  → wait for EVENT_AD_LOADED
  → show once
  → wait for EVENT_AD_CLOSED
  → load the same handle again
  → show again
```

Do not recreate the object for every impression. Call `destroy_*_ad()` only
when permanently finished with that object; destruction invalidates its handle
and a later use requires creating a new object.

Banner objects are also created once. After loading, the native banner
auto-refreshes. The same handle can be hidden and shown repeatedly without
recreating or reloading the view.

The repository example automatically creates its default interstitial,
rewarded, and banner objects after `EVENT_INIT_SUCCEEDED`. Its **Create**
buttons are mainly there to test creating another object after the corresponding
**Destroy** button has invalidated the previous handle.

See Unity's reusable-object guidance for
[interstitial](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/levelplay/sdk/android/interstitial-integration)
and
[rewarded](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/grow/levelplay/sdk/android/rewarded-ads-integration)
ads.

### Integration Test Suite

The Test Suite is a separate initialization path. Before initialization, set
`is_test_suite` metadata to `enable`. On `EVENT_INIT_SUCCEEDED`, call
`launch_test_suite()` immediately; do not create ad objects or invoke other
LevelPlay SDK operations first. Because LevelPlay initializes once per app
process, restart the app before switching between the Test Suite and the normal
ad flow. The example exposes these as separate **Initialize** and **Test suite**
buttons.

## Interstitial ads

Loading and showing are separate operations:

```lua
levelplay.load_interstitial_ad(interstitial)

-- Later, after EVENT_AD_LOADED:
local placement = "Default"
if levelplay.is_interstitial_ad_ready(interstitial)
    and not levelplay.is_interstitial_placement_capped(placement) then
    levelplay.show_interstitial_ad(interstitial, placement)
end
```

After `EVENT_AD_CLOSED`, call `load_interstitial_ad(interstitial)` again to
prepare the next impression. The same object and handle are reused.

Call `destroy_interstitial_ad()` when the object is no longer needed. Destroy
invalidates the handle and intentionally stops its future callbacks, so do not
destroy while loading or displaying when you still require the terminal event.
Use `is_interstitial_placement_capped(placement)` before presenting a
placement-driven entry point.

## Rewarded ads

```lua
levelplay.load_rewarded_ad(rewarded)

local placement = "Default"
if levelplay.is_rewarded_ad_ready(rewarded)
    and not levelplay.is_rewarded_placement_capped(placement) then
    levelplay.show_rewarded_ad(rewarded, placement)
end
```

After the reward and close callbacks have completed, call
`load_rewarded_ad(rewarded)` again to prepare the next impression. Do not
recreate the rewarded object after every show.

Grant the reward when the callback receives `MSG_REWARDED` with
`EVENT_AD_REWARDED`. The message includes the ad `handle` and reward data when
supplied by the SDK. `get_reward(handle, placement)` can inspect the dashboard
reward before showing. Never destroy a displayed rewarded object before its
reward and close callbacks; destruction invalidates the handle and stops future
callbacks.

## Banner ads

```lua
local banner = levelplay.create_banner_ad(BANNER_AD_UNIT_ID, {
    size = levelplay.BANNER_SIZE_ADAPTIVE,
    position = levelplay.BANNER_POSITION_BOTTOM,
    placement = "DefaultBanner",
    respect_safe_area = true,
})

levelplay.load_banner_ad(banner)
```

The native banner view is visible by default, so loading also displays it.
`hide_banner_ad()` preserves the banner for later display and
`show_banner_ad()` reveals it again. `pause_banner_auto_refresh()` and
`resume_banner_auto_refresh()` control refresh without changing visibility.
`destroy_banner_ad()` removes the native view and invalidates the handle.

## Callback contract

The callback signature is:

```lua
function(self, message_id, message)
```

`message_id` identifies initialization, interstitial, rewarded, banner, or tracking. Every asynchronous SDK message contains `message.event`. Events emitted by an existing ad object also contain `message.handle`, which lets one callback route events from multiple ad-unit objects; a validation error raised before creation succeeds has no handle.

Failure events include `error_code` and `error_message`; iOS can additionally supply `error_domain`. Successful ad events can include ad-unit, placement, network instance, revenue, auction, creative, and the flat size fields `ad_width`, `ad_height`, `ad_size_description`, and `ad_size_is_adaptive`. A rewarded event uses `reward_name` and `reward_amount`. iOS can additionally supply `conversion_value`. Check the event constant before reading optional fields.

See [`example/callback.lua`](https://github.com/defold/extension-levelplay/blob/main/example/callback.lua) for complete routing and [`example/main.gui_script`](https://github.com/defold/extension-levelplay/blob/main/example/main.gui_script) for the full lifecycle.
